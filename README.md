# Course overview

With the rise of data-driven technologies, including machine learning and artificial intelligence-based systems, comes enormous risks to protect the data from unauthorized and inappropriate use. The data comes from our everyday use of digital technologies, as they store all of our interactions, and learn from them. However, that data also reveals intimate details about ourselves, our lives, and our daily activities. Such knowledge is highly privacy sensitive and can be used by unauthorized entities if appropriate safeguarding mechanisms  are not in place. Additionally, ML-based models, which are trained on those data, are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This course will equip students with theoretical and hands-on knowledge on how to protect private data, and other technologies that are built on those data.
