## Class attendance
Regular class attendance and participation are required unless pre-approved by the instructor or in case of emergency. There will be a sign-in poll at the start of class every day, and in-class quizzes. Students may not get attendance credit for that class and quiz if they arrive late. Please arrive on time and ready to participate by the scheduled start time.

Important. Excused absences for classes will be given without penalty to the grade in the case of (1) a university-sanctioned event [ACD 304-02]; (2) religious holidays [ACD 304-04]; a list can be found here https://eoss.asu.edu/cora/holidays ]; (3) work performed in the line-of-duty according [SSM 201-18]; Excused absences do not relieve students from responsibility for any part of the course work required during the period of absence.

## Late submission policy for assignments
Start early and plan your time well. To account for unavoidable issues, students will get a 2-day extension for one of the assignments without asking me (except for the last homework). This should be reserved for an emergency, there will be no further extension unless prior approval.

## Course project
Students will work on privacy-related projects in groups of 4-5 students. Each group will prepare a project report and a poster to present their work.

## Plagiarism and Academic Dishonesty
This is a research-oriented course where collaboration is welcomed. But provide credit where it’s due. Plagiarism or any form of cheating in assignments or projects is subject to serious academic penalties. All engineering students are expected to adhere to the ASU Student Honor Code and the ASU academic integrity
policy, which can be found at https://provost.asu.edu/academic-integrity/policy). Students are responsible for
reviewing this policy and understanding each of the areas in which academic dishonesty can occur. If you have
taken this course before, you may not reuse or submit any part of your previous assignments without  express written permission from the instructor.
All student academic integrity violations are reported to the Fulton Schools of Engineering Academic Integrity
Office (AIO). Withdrawing from this course will not absolve you of responsibility for an academic integrity
violation and any sanctions that are applied. The AIO maintains a record of all violations and has access to
academic integrity violations committed in all other ASU colleges/schools.

You may engage in intellectual discussions about reading assignments with your peers or me, but all submissions must be your own, based on your understanding of the content. Your project report will resemble academic scholarly articles, where you must credit all sources, including your partners in brainstorming, published papers, and existing code repositories (e.g., from Stackoverflow or GitHub) that you have used in your implementation. Posting your projects online, including using a public Github repo, is expressly forbidden. The GitHub Student Developer Pack provides unlimited private repositories while you are a student.

## Generative AI
Generative AI is a technology that can often be useful in helping students learn the theories and concepts in this
course. However, unless explicitly allowed by your instructor, the use of generative AI tools to complete any
portion of a course assignment or exam will be considered academic dishonesty and a violation of the ASU
[Academic Integrity Policy](https://provost.asu.edu/academic-integrity/policy). Students confirmed to be engaging in non-allowable use of generative AI will be sanctioned according to the academic integrity policy and FSE sanctioning guidelines.

## Expected behaviors and Title IX
Students in this class are expected to acknowledge and embrace the FSE student professionalism expectation
located at: https://engineering.asu.edu/professionalism/.

Title IX is a federal law that provides that no person be excluded on the basis of sex from participation in, be denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity. Both Title IX and university policy make clear that sexual violence and harassment based on sex is prohibited. An individual who believes they have been subjected to sexual violence or harassed on the basis of sex can seek support, including counseling and academic support, from the university. If you or someone you know has been harassed on the basis of sex or sexually assaulted, you can find information and resources at https://sexualviolenceprevention.asu.edu/faqs. As mandated reporters, we are obligated to report any information we become aware of regarding alleged acts of sexual discrimination, including sexual violence and dating violence. ASU Counseling Services, https://eoss.asu.edu/counseling is available if you wish to discuss any concerns confidentially and privately. ASU online students may access 360 Life Services, https://goto.asuonline.asu.edu/success/online-resources.html.

## Disability Accommodations
Suitable accommodations are made for students having disabilities. Students needing accommodation must
register with the ASU Student Accessibility and Inclusive Learning Services office and provide documentation of
that registration to the instructor. Students should communicate the need for an accommodation in enough
time for it to be properly arranged. See [ACD 304-08](https://policy.asu.edu/#doc1541229) Classroom and Testing Accommodations for Students with
Disabilities.

## Policy against threatening behavior, per the Student Services Manual, [SSM 104–02](https://policy.asu.edu/#doc1560489)

Students, faculty, staff, and other individuals do not have an unqualified right of access to university grounds,
property, or services (see [SSM 104-02](https://policy.asu.edu/#doc1560489)). Interfering with the peaceful conduct of university-related business or activities or remaining on campus grounds after a request to leave may be considered a crime. All incidents and allegations of violent or threatening conduct by an ASU student (whether on- or off-campus) must be reported to the ASU Police Department (ASU PD) and the Office of the Dean of Students.

## Student Copyright Responsibilities
You must refrain from uploading to this course shell, discussion board, website used by the course instructor or
any other course forum, material that is not your own original work, unless you first comply with all applicable
copyright laws. Course instructors reserve the right to delete materials from the course shell on the grounds of
suspected copyright infringement.

The contents of this course, including lectures and other instructional materials, are copyrighted materials.
Students may not share outside the class, including uploading, selling or distributing course content or notes
taken during the conduct of the course. Any recording of class sessions by students is prohibited, except as part
of an accommodation approved by the Disability Resource Center. (see ACD 304–06, “Commercial Note Taking
Services” and ABOR Policy 5-308 F.14 for more information).

## Harassment and Sexual Discrimination 
Arizona State University is committed to providing an environment free of discrimination, harassment, or
retaliation for the entire university community, including all students, faculty members, staff employees, and
guests. ASU expressly prohibits discrimination, harassment, and retaliation by employees, students, contractors,
or agents of the university based on any protected status: race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age,
disability, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity, and genetic information.
Title IX is a federal law that provides that no person be excluded on the basis of sex from participation in, be
denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity. Both Title IX and
university policy make clear that sexual violence and harassment based on sex is prohibited. An individual who
believes they have been subjected to sexual violence or harassed on the basis of sex can seek support, including
counseling and academic support, from the university. If you or someone you know has been harassed on the
basis of sex or sexually assaulted, you can find information and resources at
https://sexualviolenceprevention.asu.edu/faqs.

As a mandated reporter, I am obligated to report any information I become aware of regarding alleged acts of
sexual discrimination, including sexual violence and dating violence. ASU Counseling Services,
https://eoss.asu.edu/counseling is available if you wish to discuss any concerns confidentially and privately. ASU
online students may access 360 Life Services, https://goto.asuonline.asu.edu/success/online-resources.html.

## Photo requirements
Arizona State University requires each enrolled student and university employee to have on file with ASU a
current photo that meets ASU&#39;s requirements (your "Photo"). ASU uses your Photo to identify you, as necessary, to provide you educational and related services as an enrolled student at ASU. If you do not have an acceptable
Photo on file with ASU, or if you do not consent to the use of your photo, access to ASU resources, including
access to course material or grades (online or in person) may be negatively affected, withheld or denied.
