## Class attendance
Regular class attendance and participation are required unless pre-approved by the instructor or in case of emergency. There will be a sign-in poll at the start of class every day, and in-class quizzes. Students may not get attendance credit for that class and quiz if they arrive late. Please arrive on time and ready to participate by the scheduled start time.

**Important.** Excused absences for classes will be given without penalty to the grade in the case of (1) a university-sanctioned event [ACD 304-02]; (2) religious holidays [ACD 304-04]; a list can be found here https://eoss.asu.edu/cora/holidays ]; (3) work performed in the line-of-duty according [SSM 201-18]; Excused absences do not relieve students from responsibility for any part of the course work required during the period of absence.

## Late submission policy for assignments
Start early and plan your time well. To account for unavoidable issues, students will get a 2-day extension for one of the assignments without asking me (except for the last homework). This should be reserved for an emergency, there will be no further extension unless prior approval.


## Grading policy

### Grading components
**Class attendance: 5%**

**In-class quizzes: 25%**

Short Quizzes will be administered at the beginning of every lecture (excluding Lecture 1). They will be short, and mainly aimed at making sure that you were able to follow the material covered on the previous day. The worst-performing 1 Quiz across all lectures will be discarded.

**Assignments 40%**

There will be 4 homework assignments that will involve various tasks: programming, mathematical problem solving, designing system prototypes following privacy and security principles, explaining concepts taught in the course, and so on. Written assignments will be graded based on the clarity and validity of your arguments and analysis. You can submit one assignment up to 48 hours late without any penalty. Beyond that, 10% points will be subtracted for every 24-hour delay. Three best-scoring assignments will be counted toward your grade.

**Research project 30%**

Teams of 2–4 students will work on a novel, potentially impactful, and interesting research project <ins>related to data privacy</ins>. The project should involve any combination of the activities: implementing prototypes, conducting experiments, collecting and analyzing data, and writing a report. **The goal of this research-oriented project is to generate new scientific knowledge (not just building tools)**.

You will submit a report describing your research, results, and conclusions.  The project will be graded based on 
1. Importance of the problem studied/potential impact of the solution
2. Novelty of the problem or solution, or both.
3. The scientific validity of the research methodology.
4. Quality of the writing, your ability to motivate your research, clarity in presenting the methods, drawing conclusions from your results, synthesizing knowledge and contextualizing findings from prior research, as well as its conciseness.

**Project milestones**

You will complete the project in multiple milestones, and each milestone will be graded *independently* of the other parts.
1. Proposal (5): By the end of Week 3, submit a short (2-page max) research proposal. At a minimum, it must contain:
    1. Name of the project team and names of students on the team
    2. Problem statement, Research questions and hypotheses (if applicable), and expected contribution
    3. Research approach: Prototyping/implementing and evaluating software artifacts, comparing existing apps, Data Analysis, Surveys or Interviews, and so on.
    4. If implementation-focused, explain what technology/resources you will use, and how you will evaluate the implemented system.
    5. Data collection: describe the type of quantitative and/or qualitative data you expect to collect, if you plan to conduct user studies, how will you develop the questionnaire?
    6. Data analysis: what quantitative and/or qualitative approaches do you expect to use to analyze your data
    7. Collaboration plan: How often will the team meet? How will you communicate? How do you expect to divide up the work?
3. Intermediate project report (10):  Provide a progress report (max 3 pages) with intermediate results by the end of Week 8. <ins>By that time, you must be able to complete at least 30% of what you had proposed to do</ins>. Explain unresolved issues and challenges, how will you resolve them? Provide a timeline to complete the remaining tasks and write the project report. How will you distribute the workload among the team members?
4. Final report (15): Extend the status report with all results, discuss, interpret, and contextualize the results, and draw conclusions from them.  

**Tips about the final project**

1. You should start thinking about the final project very soon and form a team with those who have similar interests.
2. We will discuss some project ideas in the class as examples of interesting topics.
3. You may find ideas for possible project topics by “glancing ahead” at the course’s topics for future weeks. If some topic seems interesting but you are not very familiar with it, talk with me or the TAs.
4. You may also find ideas by checking websites such as [Markup](https://themarkup.org/series/privacy), [EPIC](http://www.epic.org/), [IAPP Privacy consortium](http://www.privacyassociation.org/), [Common Sense Media]https://www.commonsense.org/), and Future of [Privacy Forum](fpf.org).

**NOTE: We reserve the right to curve the grades depending on the circumstances**.

### Bonus points

Students can earn bonus points throughout the semester in various ways:
- **Assignment submission:** 1 bonus point for submitting assignments at least one hour before the deadline. 
- **Ask questions:** 1 bonus point for asking a thought-provoking question during the lecture. 
- **Answer questions:** A discord channel will be created to ask and answer questions. You will get 1 bonus point if at least 3 people find your answer to a question useful (please upvote or like the answer if you found it useful). Questions must be non-trivial to answer.
- **Publishing research:** You can get 5% bonus points for your project if you create a blog post video presentation explaining your research and make it public, and publish the codebase (if any) in an <ins>extremely easy-to-use format with comprehensive documentation</ins>. The blog post/video presentation must be prepared in a way that is understandable by anyone curious about scientific research. **Note:** if your project involves human subjects data collection, you must obtain IRB approval *before* conducting the research to make sure that your research method is ethical. Talk to me or the TA if you need assistance with this process. You can also aim to publish your research at a conference/journal/workshop. If applicable, you can continue working on the project toward a publication after the semester ends, and we can explore possible ways to get funding to do this.

**NOTE: The instructor and TAs reserve exclusive rights to determine if a question/answer/post deserves the bonus point.**


## Plagiarism and Academic Dishonesty
**This is a research-oriented course where collaboration is welcomed. But provide credit where it’s due.** 

Plagiarism or any form of cheating in assignments or projects is subject to serious academic penalties. All engineering students are expected to adhere to the ASU Student Honor Code and the ASU academic integrity policy, which can be found at https://provost.asu.edu/academic-integrity/policy). Students are responsible for reviewing this policy and understanding each of the areas in which academic dishonesty can occur. If you have
taken this course before, you may not reuse or submit any part of your previous assignments without  express written permission from the instructor.
All student academic integrity violations are reported to the Fulton Schools of Engineering Academic Integrity Office (AIO). Withdrawing from this course will not absolve you of responsibility for an academic integrity violation and any sanctions that are applied. The AIO maintains a record of all violations and has access to academic integrity violations committed in all other ASU colleges/schools.

You may engage in intellectual discussions about reading assignments with your peers or me, but all submissions must be your own, based on your understanding of the content. Your project report will resemble academic scholarly articles, where you must credit all sources, including your partners in brainstorming, published papers, and existing code repositories (e.g., from Stackoverflow or GitHub) that you have used in your implementation. Posting your projects online before the semester ends, including using a public Github repo, is expressly forbidden. The GitHub Student Developer Pack provides unlimited private repositories while you are a student.

## Generative AI
Generative AI is a technology that can often be useful in helping students learn the theories and concepts in this course. However, unless explicitly allowed by your instructor, the use of generative AI tools to complete any portion of a course assignment or exam will be considered academic dishonesty and a violation of the ASU [Academic Integrity Policy](https://provost.asu.edu/academic-integrity/policy). Students confirmed to be engaging in non-allowable use of generative AI will be sanctioned according to the academic integrity policy and FSE sanctioning guidelines.

## Expected behaviors and Title IX
Students in this class are expected to acknowledge and embrace the FSE student professionalism expectation
located at: https://engineering.asu.edu/professionalism/.

Title IX is a federal law that provides that no person be excluded on the basis of sex from participation in, be denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity. Both Title IX and university policy make clear that sexual violence and harassment based on sex is prohibited. An individual who believes they have been subjected to sexual violence or harassed on the basis of sex can seek support, including counseling and academic support, from the university. If you or someone you know has been harassed on the basis of sex or sexually assaulted, you can find information and resources at https://sexualviolenceprevention.asu.edu/faqs. As mandated reporters, we are obligated to report any information we become aware of regarding alleged acts of sexual discrimination, including sexual violence and dating violence. ASU Counseling Services, https://eoss.asu.edu/counseling is available if you wish to discuss any concerns confidentially and privately. ASU online students may access 360 Life Services, https://goto.asuonline.asu.edu/success/online-resources.html.

## Disability Accommodations
Suitable accommodations are made for students having disabilities. Students needing accommodation must
register with the ASU Student Accessibility and Inclusive Learning Services office and provide documentation of
that registration to the instructor. Students should communicate the need for an accommodation in enough
time for it to be properly arranged. See [ACD 304-08](https://policy.asu.edu/#doc1541229) Classroom and Testing Accommodations for Students with
Disabilities.

## Policy against threatening behavior, per the Student Services Manual, [SSM 104–02](https://policy.asu.edu/#doc1560489)

Students, faculty, staff, and other individuals do not have an unqualified right of access to university grounds,
property, or services (see [SSM 104-02](https://policy.asu.edu/#doc1560489)). Interfering with the peaceful conduct of university-related business or activities or remaining on campus grounds after a request to leave may be considered a crime. All incidents and allegations of violent or threatening conduct by an ASU student (whether on- or off-campus) must be reported to the ASU Police Department (ASU PD) and the Office of the Dean of Students.

## Student Copyright Responsibilities
You must refrain from uploading to this course shell, discussion board, website used by the course instructor or
any other course forum, material that is not your own original work, unless you first comply with all applicable
copyright laws. Course instructors reserve the right to delete materials from the course shell on the grounds of
suspected copyright infringement.

The contents of this course, including lectures and other instructional materials, are copyrighted materials.
Students may not share outside the class, including uploading, selling or distributing course content or notes
taken during the conduct of the course. Any recording of class sessions by students is prohibited, except as part
of an accommodation approved by the Disability Resource Center. (see ACD 304–06, “Commercial Note Taking
Services” and ABOR Policy 5-308 F.14 for more information).

## Harassment and Sexual Discrimination 
Arizona State University is committed to providing an environment free of discrimination, harassment, or
retaliation for the entire university community, including all students, faculty members, staff employees, and
guests. ASU expressly prohibits discrimination, harassment, and retaliation by employees, students, contractors,
or agents of the university based on any protected status: race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age,
disability, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity, and genetic information.
Title IX is a federal law that provides that no person be excluded on the basis of sex from participation in, be
denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity. Both Title IX and
university policy make clear that sexual violence and harassment based on sex is prohibited. An individual who
believes they have been subjected to sexual violence or harassed on the basis of sex can seek support, including
counseling and academic support, from the university. If you or someone you know has been harassed on the
basis of sex or sexually assaulted, you can find information and resources at
https://sexualviolenceprevention.asu.edu/faqs.

As a mandated reporter, I am obligated to report any information I become aware of regarding alleged acts of
sexual discrimination, including sexual violence and dating violence. ASU Counseling Services,
https://eoss.asu.edu/counseling is available if you wish to discuss any concerns confidentially and privately. ASU
online students may access 360 Life Services, https://goto.asuonline.asu.edu/success/online-resources.html.

## Photo requirements
Arizona State University requires each enrolled student and university employee to have on file with ASU a
current photo that meets ASU&#39;s requirements (your "Photo"). ASU uses your Photo to identify you, as necessary, to provide you educational and related services as an enrolled student at ASU. If you do not have an acceptable
Photo on file with ASU, or if you do not consent to the use of your photo, access to ASU resources, including
access to course material or grades (online or in person) may be negatively affected, withheld or denied.
